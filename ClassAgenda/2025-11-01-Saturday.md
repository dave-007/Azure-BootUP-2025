## Cloud Career Concepts

> Tell me what programming or scripting language to learn!

- Programming Language Choice as Career Direction
  - **Scripting Languages**: PowerShell and Bash are essential for cloud automation and administration
  - **General Purpose Languages**: Python and C# are highly marketable and versatile
  - **Systems Languages**: Go and Rust may open unique opportunities in infrastructure and systems programming
  - Recommendation: Follow your curiosity & excitement, you might master one favorite language, but understand basics of others
  - Your language choice can shape your career trajectory in cloud engineering

## Today's Topics
### Storage: Core Concepts

Understanding Azure Storage Accounts helps understand Azure resources in general. Storage accounts demonstrate:
- Resource configuration patterns
- Access control models
- Redundancy and availability options
- Cost optimization strategies
- Multiple access methods (Portal, CLI, PowerShell, SDKs, REST API, Infrastructure as Code)
  - Scripting: PowerShell, Bash/Azure CLI
  - Programming: Python, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust
  - Infrastructure as Code: Bicep, Terraform, ARM Templates
  - [Quick start guide for working with Azure Storage using various tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli)

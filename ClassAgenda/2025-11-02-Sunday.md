## Challenge Content

### Storage Automation Challenge
Go beyond the Azure Portal by automating storage account operations using your preferred tools.

#### Challenge Goals
1. **Create a storage account** using code/scripts
2. **Create a blob container OR file share**
3. **Add and modify content** in your container/share
4. **Modify a useful property** of the storage account based on your interest
   - Examples: Change access tier, configure lifecycle management, update redundancy settings

#### Tools to Explore
Choose your favorite method(s) and practice at least the basics with others:

**PowerShell**
- [Azure PowerShell Storage cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.storage/)
- Great for Windows automation and scripting

**Azure CLI**
- [Azure CLI storage commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage)
- Cross-platform command-line interface

**SDKs (Choose your favorite language)**
- **Python**: [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python)
- **C#/.NET**: [Azure Storage SDK for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet)
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: [Azure Storage SDK for JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-nodejs)
- **Java**: [Azure Storage SDK for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-java)
- **Go**: [Azure Storage SDK for Go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go)
- **Rust**: [Azure SDK for Rust](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust)

**Direct Azure REST API**
- [Azure Storage REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/)
- Understanding the REST API helps you understand how all SDKs work
- Use tools like Postman or curl for testing

#### Resources for Challenge
- Documentation and your favorite LLMs are your friends! 
  - Using VSCode & have a GitHub account? Test out GitHub Copilot to help with scripting!
- Experiment, break things, learn, and rebuild
- Share your solutions and learnings with classmates

## VS Code Exploration

### Getting Started with VS Code for Azure
1. **Install Azure Extensions**
   - Azure Account extension
   - Azure Storage extension
   - Azure Resources extension

2. **Using VS Code for:**
   - Taking and organizing notes in Markdown
   - Writing and testing scripts (PowerShell, Python, etc.)
   - Interacting with your Azure account directly
   - Managing Azure Storage resources visually

3. **Best Practices**
   - Use integrated terminal for running commands
   - Leverage Git integration for version control
   - Use IntelliSense for Azure SDK development

## Q&A Time
- Questions from Saturday's lecture
- Lab troubleshooting
- Challenge content support
- Career and learning path discussions


## Issues

- Atlas machines are locked down differently for different employee roles, prevent a consistent experience. Will recommend class proceeds on personal PCs against personal Azure accounts, with awareness of the costs supported with Budget & Cost anomaly alerts. 
- Explore whether we can assign the VSES subscriptions to be controlled by personal accounts as an alternative.
- Need an Atlas security contact to smooth out learner experiences.
- Dependency manangement for Atlas workstations (.Net 8 for AzStEx)

## Challenge Content

### Storage Automation Challenge
Go beyond the Azure Portal by automating storage account operations using your preferred tools.

#### Challenge Goals
1. **Create a storage account** using code/scripts
2. **Create a blob container OR file share**
3. **Add and modify content** in your container/share
4. **Modify a useful property** of the storage account based on your interest
   - Examples: Change access tier, configure lifecycle management, update redundancy settings

#### Tools to Explore
Choose your favorite method(s) and practice at least the basics with others:

**PowerShell**
- [Azure PowerShell Storage cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.storage/)
- Great for Windows automation and scripting

**Azure CLI**
- [Azure CLI storage commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage)
- Cross-platform command-line interface

**SDKs (Choose your favorite language)**
- **Python**: [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python)
- **C#/.NET**: [Azure Storage SDK for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet)
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: [Azure Storage SDK for JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-nodejs)
- **Java**: [Azure Storage SDK for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-java)
- **Go**: [Azure Storage SDK for Go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go)
- **Rust**: [Azure SDK for Rust](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust)

**Direct Azure REST API**
- [Azure Storage REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/)
- Understanding the REST API helps you understand how all SDKs work
- Use tools like Postman or curl for testing

#### Resources for Challenge

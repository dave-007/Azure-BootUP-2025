  - Add a custom domain to your PERSONAL TENANT




## Challenges (for folks that have done the labs and want more)


### When using Portal to perform tasks in the labs, do the equivalent tasks in AZCLI & PowerShell. 
        > To address security limitations, open Cloud Shell in the personal tenant subscription.

        > Save your scripts! Use a private Gitub repo, or where do you prefer to save your scripts.

### Custom Domain
        - Add a custom domain to your PERSONAL TENANT
        

### Dedicated admin account
> It is useful to create a new account in your personal tenant, make it global administrator, and owner of the subscription.

> Logging in with that account rather than your personal email account will simplify things going forward.

  - Use Microsoft Authenticator for that account.
  - TODO: Passwordless after we add Entra P2 trial next week


## TODO

- Set up Azure Mobile App, notifications
- Enable Entra P2 trial and demo SSPR
- Policy examples
- Can A admins use mgmt group or admin units to grant some entra permissions over their VSES subscriptions to the students safely?
